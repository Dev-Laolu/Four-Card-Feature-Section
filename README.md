## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Implementation Steps

1.  **HTML Structure**: Created the semantic structure of the page using `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<article>` tags. Grouped content logically for the grid layout.
2.  **CSS Variables**: Defined CSS custom properties for the color palette (Primary Red, Cyan, Orange, Blue) and typography to ensure consistency.
3.  **Mobile Layout**: Implemented a responsive mobile-first approach. On smaller screens, the cards stack vertically in a single column using Flexbox.
4.  **Desktop Layout**: Used CSS Grid to create the 3-column layout. 
    - The grid has 3 columns and 2 rows.
    - "Supervisor" spans 2 rows in the first column.
    - "Team Builder" and "Karma" occupy the second column.
    - "Calculator" spans 2 rows in the third column.
    - Adjusted vertical alignment to vertically center the side cards relative to the middle column.
5.  **Styling & Polish**: Added the specific colored borders to the top of each card, applied box shadows for depth, and positioned the icons absolutely within the cards.
